# Express APIs

All APIs in the `express` directory are hosted on Express. There is an api using MongoDB, one using MySql, and another using SQLite. Both use the same set of commands to setup and run the API:

## Running up the API

```bash
cd [directory_name]
npm run dev
```

## Setting environment variables

Each flask API comes with a `.env` file, which you can use to add and modify environment variables. This is where you will set your database URIs.
