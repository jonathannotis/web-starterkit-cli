# Flask APIs

All APIs in the `django` directory are hosted on Django. There is an api using MongoDB and another using SQLite. Both use the same set of commands to setup and run the API:

## Running up the API

```bash
cd [directory_name]
# Create a python virtual environment and use it.
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
# Install Python packages using pip3.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run and configure the django APIs, follow the directions.txt file in the directory.
